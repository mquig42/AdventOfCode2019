        : In this puzzle, the robot can jump onto a space that it's impossible
		: to continue from. If it jumps to D, it can do one of 2 things next
		: 1. walk 1 space to E
		: 2. jump 4 spaces to H
		: So, only jump if E or H are true
		: This condition can be added to the end of part 1's program.
        : J = (D * !(A*B*C)) * (E+H)
NOT J T : J is False, so put a True value in T
AND A T
AND B T
AND C T : T is now False if there are any holes in the next 3 spaces, otherwise True
NOT T T : Invert T
AND D T : T is now True if D is True and there are holes in A, B, or C
OR  E J : Use J as temp storage to evaluate (E OR H)
OR  H J
AND T J : Combine results of both conditions into J
